# Project Expectations

## Overview

Every project will be run slightly different but overall this document will outline a baseline of expectations from the developer and development team.

## Developer Expectations

- Daily Commits for days spent working on the project.
- Utilize Branching Strategy per our [Source Control](./source-control.md) guidelines.
- PRs must contain useful information for reviewers.
- PRs must be assigned to a reviewer. Even if the reviewer is not on the project.
- When completing a bug, mark it ready for testing and assign it to the QA Engineer.
- When a feature/bug fix has been deployed to a testing environment, verify the state of the feature before assigning the card to QA Engineer.
- Offer the QA Engineer a demo of your feature.

## Development Team Expectations

- All tasks identified and estimated in JIRA/Trello.
- Weekly/Bi-weekly sprint meetings.
- At least one scrum meeting per week.
- Project will have 2 weeks, at minimum, dedicated QA time.
- Development team must be aware of deadlines.
- Keep project-based communication to the dedicated project slack channel. Resist temptation to use Direct Messages as they make searching for past messages much more difficult.
- If estimates are being missed for tasks, red flags must be raised to alert the team.
  - Identify how the team can make up lost time; perhaps we can shift `nice-to-have` features to a later phase, or add additional engineers to assist.
  - Identify how much more time the team needs to accomplish the tasks.
  - Re-estimate remaining incomplete tasks to make sure they are accurate.
